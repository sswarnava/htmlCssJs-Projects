                <li>Testing conducted by Apple in May 2023 using preproduction Apple Vision Pro units and software.
                    Testing
                    consisted of full battery discharge while performing each of the following tasks: video playback,
                    internet
                    browsing, spatial video capture, and FaceTime. Video playback tested in conjunction with an
                    Environment,
                    using 2D movie content purchased from the Apple TV app. Internet browsing tested using 20 popular
                    websites.
                    FaceTime tested between two Apple Vision Pro units with Personas enabled. Tested with Wi-Fi
                    associated
                    to a
                    network. Battery life depends on device settings, usage, network, environmental conditions, and many
                    other
                    factors. Battery tests are conducted using specific Apple Vision Pro units; actual results may vary.
